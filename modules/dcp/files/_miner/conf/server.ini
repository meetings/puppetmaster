# OPENINTERACT 2.x SERVER CONFIGURATION
#  This is the main configuration file for OpenInteract 2.x. All
#  comments can be removed with a one-liner:
#
#    perl -ne 'print unless /^\s*#/' < server.ini > server_new.ini

# Items in this section will be available from the configuration
# object's root, at least for the time being
#
#   promote_oi
#      If set to 'yes' I'll put a 'X-Powered-By' header in all the
#      pages I serve.
#   ConfigurationRevision
#      Used for debugging
#   timezone
#      Set to a timezone that can be used as the 'time_zone' parameter
#      in a DateTime object (which in turn should be able to be used
#      as the 'name' parameter to the DateTime::TimeZone->new()
#      constructor.
